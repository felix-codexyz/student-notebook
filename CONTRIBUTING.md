## 🖥️ Preview Your Changes with MkDocs

Before submitting a Pull Request, you can preview your notebook or lab using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).

### Step 1: Install MkDocs

```bash
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material
```

### Step 2: Run the Local Server

from the root of the project (where mkdocs.yml lives):
```bash
mkdocs serve
```
Then visit: http://localhost:8000

### Step 3: Troubleshoot

- If the site fails to build, check for:
  - Bad links or missing files in `docs/`
  - Indentation issues in `mkdocs.yml`
  - Missing frontmatter headers (`# Title`) in Markdown

✅ Good to Know
- All docs are located under `docs/`
- MkDocs auto-reloads as you save changes
- This is the same setup used to publish your portfolio site via GitHub Pages
